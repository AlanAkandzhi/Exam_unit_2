# Exam_unit_2

//Task 1

In this task, we needed to write a program that changes temperature from Fahrenheit to Celsius and shows the result with two numbers after the decimal point. The code I wrote uses a simple formula to do the conversion. Then, to make sure the temperature in Celsius has exactly two decimal places, I added "double answer = Math.Round(tempCelsiusAsInt, 2);" to the code. This line rounds the answer to the required precision.
